      <title>Fundamental mathematical models in evolution</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;phd-course-fundamental-mathematical-models-in-evolution-course-coordinator&#34;&gt;PhD course Fundamental mathematical models in evolution (Course coordinator)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a doctoral course aimed to provide a broad survey of well-known mathematical models in evolution. Emphasis is placed on understanding the basic formulation of each model, its underlying assumptions, its key results, and possible extensions. The course is inherently interdisciplinary and its intended audience is PhD students from mathematical and computational sciences as well as those from evolution and/or ecology. To facilitate student learning, after each lecture students were tasked with finding a relevant publication and giving a formal presentation on its motivation and use of the discussed mathematical model. Students would take turns presenting to one another in small groups and all presentations would be shared in a common directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 1: Exponential growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 2: Price equation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 3: Fitness landscapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 4: Hamilton&amp;rsquo;s rule&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 5: Evolutionary game theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 6: Trait groups&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 7: Models of neutral evolution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 8: Evolutionary graph theory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 9: Adaptive dynamics&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 10: Error castastrophes and quasispecies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 11: NK model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lecture 12: Cellular automata and digital evolution (AVIDA)&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Differential Equations</title>
      <link>http://ericlibby.github.io/teaching/differential_equations/</link>

      <guid>http://ericlibby.github.io/teaching/differential_equations/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the basic course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kursplan/5ma121/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;5MA121&lt;/a&gt; in differential equations aimed at second year students. The course covers the formulating and solving first and second order ordinary differential equations. Additional topics include nonlinear dynamics, the Laplace transform, Fourier series, and an introduction to solving partial differential equations. Emphasis is placed on teaching students different ways to model physical and biological systems with differential equations. Students are evaluated by exams and a computer lab that requires the students to use MATLAB to numerically solve differential equations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary text is &lt;em&gt;Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 2017 edition&lt;/em&gt; by William Boyce (ISBN 9781119382874). Additional material is drawn from &lt;em&gt;Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos&lt;/em&gt; by Steven Strogatz and &lt;em&gt;Understanding Nonlinear Dynamics&lt;/em&gt; by Daniel Kaplan and Leon Glass.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Industrial economics</title>
      <link>http://ericlibby.github.io/teaching/industrial_economics/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a thesis course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kursplan/5MA145&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;5MA145&lt;/a&gt; for a master&amp;rsquo;s degree in industrial economics. The students set up a collaborative project with a company and conduct independent work within one of the areas of the industrial economics education. I serve as the academic mentor to the thesis with regular meetings to help the student produce an appropriate thesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my students:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Elias Björklund (2021) “Trading strategies based on a pattern detection algorithm” at Amplify Capital&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Julia Karlsson &amp;amp; Moa Sjöström (2020) “Forecasts of PMI” at Nordea&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>Linear Algebra</title>
      <link>http://ericlibby.github.io/teaching/linear_algebra/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://ericlibby.github.io/teaching/linear_algebra/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the basic course &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.umu.se/utbildning/kursplan/5ma160/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;5MA160&lt;/a&gt; in linear algebra aimed at first year students. We cover the usual elements of most linear algebra courses including solving systems of linear equations, manipulating matrices, computing eigenvalues, and working with the fundamental theorem of linear algebra. One goal of the course is to build geometric intuition in the students by studying vectors in 2 and 3 dimensional spaces so that they might better understand higher dimensional spaces. The course covers both abstract concepts such as the theory of general vector spaces as well as practical applications such as markov chains and networks. Students are evaluated by exams and a computer lab that requires the students to use MATLAB to apply their linear algebra knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary text is &lt;em&gt;Elementary linear algebra: with supplemental applications 12th edition&lt;/em&gt; by Anton Howard and Rorres Chris (ISBN 9781119666141). Additional material is drawn from &lt;em&gt;Introduction to Linear Algebra 4th edition&lt;/em&gt; by Gilbert Strang, &lt;em&gt;Linear Algebra 3rd edition&lt;/em&gt; by Jim Hefferon, and videos by 3blue1brown on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.3blue1brown.com/essence-of-linear-algebra-page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Essence of linear algebra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
