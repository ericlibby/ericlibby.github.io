      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sasha graduated from Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, where for his master&amp;rsquo;s degree he applied deep learning methods to structural bioinformatics. At IceLab, he aims to use similar techniques to determine whether microbes can distinguish friends from foes. His PhD is a joint project with Eric Libby and Laura Carroll, funded through the SciLifeLab Data-Driven Life Science (DDLS) research school. In his free time, he plays chess and reads books. He enjoys the tranquility of the woods and the beauty of the natural world, but from a safe distance. He used to practice judo in high school and even managed to keep both of his arms functional.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defne received her MSc degree in Mathematics from Izmir Institute of Technology. During her master’s degree, she studied ordinary and partial differential equations and their numerical solutions. She investigated the solution properties of physical and chemical problems as she implemented numerical algorithms to solve and/or simulate them. Beyond the academic realm, she is from Izmir and enjoys watching art house cinema, listening to timeless tunes, and spending time in nature through hiking and camping.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hanna started her PhD in Fall 2019. She is based at Icelab and the Umeå University Mathematics Department. Her studies focus on understanding the evolution of multicellular life cycles and in particular how their early structure influences adaptation. She enjoys playing the organ and bird-watching among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
